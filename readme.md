## Intro
I decide to make this repo public, because decide to write some notes on How I thought about the whole development. Also many people asked about how the ininity effect implement. I would like to write it gradually when I have time. 

I redid this website with react, this one is old version with vanila JS and Three.js. 

Before I stop update it, I was trying to rewite "project upload", so you can see some project files with "copy " version. I try to let the program auto-load all the files and match the addresses within the Path.js. I didn't really figure it out, so I decide give React a shot. 

The basic coding orgnizing structure comes from Bruno Simon's [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) with Webpack to bundle everything.
